# Stocks
#### The goal of this project was to become more familiar with python and other libraries. While also being able to have a helpfuil tool/visualizer for stocks I own.

What I use to achieve this:
* Pyhton Libraries
  * Pandas - Data frames and management
  * yfinance - Yahoo fiance data API
  * Dash - GUI 
  * Plotly - Graphing engine/make dash
  * robin_stocks - Robbinhood API
  * 
With these tools combined I created a "app" that allows you to login into a robinhood accoutn and revive data bout the account and display more indpeth information for that account and it's securities.
